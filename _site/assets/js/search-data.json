    "content": "# Combining CAD and XR One of the most common challenges when trying to use a CAD file within VR or AR is model compatibility. A CAD tool models are based on B-REP models : set of free-form pacthes (NURBS, etc) saving information into native formats. A VR models focuss on visualisation based on polyhedron models (obj, stl, fbx). For this reason CAD files must be converted before being used in XR. Model conversion can be represented by the following structure ![]({{page.image | relative_url}}) [CAD2VR](http://195.83.77.22/stepvrweb/){: .btn .btn-blue } ",
