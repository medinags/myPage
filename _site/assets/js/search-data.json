    "content": "# Research Problem The architecture of technical systems requires an extensive number of modelling and simulation software capabilites to define each view. So far, each view relies on a set of models developed in domain specific software. # Research Proposal The project ArchiTOOL aims at inventing and prototyping an immersive and intelligent virtual environment for the architecture of complex socio-technical systems. New visual and interactive metaphors support the design of a multi-view architecture in a unique virtual space. The systems thinking ontologyn, which underlies the human-machine interface, structures the core information in a graph. Finally, the integration of reasoning and machine learning capabilities into the virtual environment provides users with context-aware virtual scenes. ![goal.png](/assets/images/goal.png) # Proofs of Concept # contact **Romain Pinquié** - *Assistant Professor* - project contact: romain.pinquie@grenoble-inp.fr **Haobo Wang** - *PhD Candidate* **Frédéric Noel** - *Full Professor* ",
