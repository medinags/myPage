<p>The architecture of technical systems requires an extensive number of modelling and simulation software capabilites to define each view. So far, each view relies on a set of models developed in domain specific software.</p>

<h1 id="research-proposal">Research Proposal</h1>

<p>The project ArchiTOOL aims at inventing and prototyping an immersive and intelligent virtual environment for the architecture of complex socio-technical systems. New visual and interactive metaphors support the design of a multi-view architecture in a unique virtual space. The systems thinking ontologyn, which underlies the human-machine interface, structures the core information in a graph. Finally, the integration of reasoning and machine learning capabilities into the virtual environment provides users with context-aware virtual scenes.</p>
