# Combining CAD and XR

One of the most common challenges when trying to use a CAD file within VR or AR is model compatibility. A CAD tool models are based on B-REP models : set of free-form pacthes (NURBS, etc) saving information into native formats. A VR models focuss on visualisation based on polyhedron models (obj, stl, fbx). For this reason CAD files must be converted before being used in XR. <br>
Model conversion can be represented by the following structure <br>
